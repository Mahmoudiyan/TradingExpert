## My Suggestion

**Try OANDA first** - we already have it implemented and it's working. But if you want alternatives:

1. **If you're in the US**: Try **Alpaca** - easiest integration
2. **If you need global access**: Try **Interactive Brokers** or stick with **OANDA**
3. **If you want MT5-based**: Use your existing MT5 EA (already built!)

Let me know which one you'd like to try, and I'll implement it! The code structure is already set up to easily add new brokers.
